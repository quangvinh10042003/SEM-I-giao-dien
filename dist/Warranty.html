                    <p>With your purchase and registration of GIGABYTE / AORUS products (limited to products listed on our official websites:
                        <a>https://www.aorus.com</a>/<a>
                            https://www.gigabyte.com/</a>; regional differences may apply), GIGA-BYTE Technology Co., Ltd. (“GIGABYTE”) warrants the GIGABYTE / AORUS products (the “Product”) to be free from defects in workmanship and materials for the
                        applicable warranty period from the date of purchase (see product-specific warranty period information in the chart below), subject to the Terms and Conditions herein.
                    </p>
                    <p>If the Product fails during normal and proper use within the warranty period, GIGABYTE will, at its discretion, repair or replace the Product. The defective parts within the Product, or the Product itself, will be replaced with functional
                        equivalents using new or refurbished parts or units. Repair or replacement is subject to the original configuration. Localized components (e.g., Korean keyboard, etc.) serviced outside the country of localization, will be serviced
                        with components conforming to the country of service. For example, if your unit was purchased with a US keyboard, and you travel to China where your keyboard requires service, your US keyboard will be replaced with a Chinese keyboard.
                        Repaired or replaced items are warranted for the length of the balance of the original product warranty period or ninety (90) calendar days from the date of service completion, whichever is longer.
                    </p>
                    <p>If a Product is near the end of a given warranty period and a repair/replacement is not possible GIGABYTE reserves the right to offer an alternative of equal or greater value or a partial refund proportional to the remaining warranty
                        life of the Product.
                    </p>
                    <p>Please note that the warranty term and warranty periods will vary by specific Product and may differ from one region to another; please inquire with the shops where originally purchased or our local offices. If you would like to verify
                        the warranty term for the Product bought, please kindly contact our local offices. Our service contact information can be found on the web at

                        <li>
                            <p>Our Lifetime Warranty does not apply to defects caused by normal use and tear, damage caused by accidents, abusive use, negligence, fire, liquid contact or other external cause, damage which is the consequence of failing to
                                comply with the user manual, damage caused by use with another product, damage caused by service by anyone who is not authorized by us, or if the product is stolen or if any label or identification number has been removed
                                from the product or has been changed.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>Once the products are announced EOL, lifetime warranty service will not be provided. This decision can be based on a number of factors which include but are not limited to the availability of certain manufacturing components
                                needed to continue production, a third-party manufacturer’s product discontinuation or the introduction of a newer product with more advanced features and functionality. For a product declared EOL, confirmed by GIGABYTE,
                                we will replace with a similar or equivalent product. GIGABYTE reserves the right to modify or terminate the site and/or any of its interactive components at any time and in any manner.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>If the alternative is provided by us with the confirmation of replacement, it will be available for lifetime warranty service as well. The equivalent product here means the products with the same fulfilling functions. For example,
                                if DDR4 3200MHz 2*8GB RGB Memory declared EOL, it will be replaced with other models which are DDR4/3200MHz/2*8GB RGB memory.</p>
